Guile, The Gilt User Interface Librarye
=======================================

A collection of iOS componentsÂ from the team at Gilt Mobile. This project is young; more details and functionality will be added soon.

## iOS Components

### Status bar message area!


### Autocompleting Text Field!
Built on top of UITextField, with support for arbitrary suggestions.

### More coming soon!
The project is an ongoing effort.

## Demo App

A demo app project is embedded in the Guile framework project. It runs in the iOS simulator or on device.

## Using Guile

There are three primary methods of using Guile in your project

1. Download Guile.framework, then drag it into your Xcode project
2. Clone guile and include it as a sub-project of your Xcode project
3. Using CocoaPods (a sample Podfile is in GuileDemo)

I recommend option #1.

## Dependencies

A few Apple frameworks are needed to use Guile. They're probably already part of your project:

- Foundation
- UIKit
- QuartzCore

## Building The Framework

### Combined iOS Device / Simulator Framework

To build Guile as a universal framework, you must ensure that the aggregate "Framework" build scheme is selected. Then simply use Command+B. To find the resulting Guile.framework: in the project navigator, right-click on libGuile.a under Products and select "Show In Finder".

### Seperate iOS Device / Simulator Frameworks

You might want to reduce the size of the distributed library by only including minimum architectures for an iOS device. In this case, you'll need to build Guile twice: once targetting a simulator and again tagetting iOS Device. When building for iOS Device, open the project's Build Settings for Guile (the library) and set **Build Active Architecture Only** to true. Add both framework version to your app's project, then link one debug and another to your distribution target. (Honestly this is overkill; most folks would be better off compiling Guile in as a submodule)
