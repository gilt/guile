Guile, The Gilt User Interface Librarye
=======================================

A collection of iOS componentsÂ from the team at Gilt Mobile. This project is young; more details and functionality will be added soon.

## Components

- Status bar message area
- More coming soon!

## Demo App

A demo app project is embedded in the Guile framework project. It runs in the iOS simulator or on device.

## Using Guile

There are three primary methods of using Guile in your project

1. Download Guile.framework, then drag it into your XCode project
2. Clone guile and include it as a sub-project of your XCode project
3. Using Cocoapods (a sample Podfile is in GuileDemo)

I recommend option #1.

## Dependencies

A few Apple frameworks are needed to use Guile. They're probably already part of your project:

- Foundation
- UIKit
- QuartzCore

## Building the framework

To build Guile as a framework, you need to first install the IOS-Universal-Framework XCode templates. This can be done automatically by executing `./setup-xcode.sh`.

The `setup-xcode.sh` script will clone the IOS-Universal-Framework repository as a submodule, and execute it's installer.
